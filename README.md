# STL-sorting-searching
Generic type implementation of an algorithms library for sorting and searching to fully understand the varying time complexity, types, definitions and nuances of sorting/searching algorithms as a whole. This is based off of STL <algorithm> 

# Overview
While not having a formal class in Data Structures and Algorithms, I felt a sense of need to better my understanding of these concepts in recent days. Most of what was learned involving this topic was mainly through the various classes taken at university, some of which in the later focusing somewhat on this topic but never going in great detail. This being said, learning is very much two fold. Researching and studying, then implementing and analyzing. This is the approach that was taken for this project in itself
